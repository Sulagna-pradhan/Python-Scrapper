# Python Introduction

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** created in **1991 by Guido van Rossum**.  
It was designed with a strong emphasis on **code readability**, allowing developers to express ideas using fewer lines of code compared to many other languages.

Python is widely used in:
- Web scraping
- Automation and scripting
- Data analysis
- Machine learning
- Web development

## Key Features of Python

- **Easy to read and write** – syntax is close to plain English  
- **Dynamically typed** – no need to declare variable types explicitly  
- **Interpreted language** – code runs line by line  
- **Cross-platform** – works on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- **Supports multiple paradigms**:
  - Object-Oriented
  - Functional
  - Procedural programming  

These features make Python an excellent choice for beginners and professionals alike.

## Understanding the “Hello, World!” Program

The simplest Python program prints a message to the screen.

```python
# This is a comment. It will not be executed.
print("Hello, World!")
````

**Output:**

```text
Hello, World!
```

### How it works

* `print()` is a built-in Python function used to display output.
* `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** (a sequence of characters).
* Anything written after `#` is a **comment**. Comments are ignored by Python and are used to explain code.

---

## Comments in Python

### Single-line Comment

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

### Multi-line Comment (Docstring)

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It is often used to describe
modules, functions, or classes.
"""
```

## Indentation in Python (Very Important)

Python uses **indentation** to define blocks of code.
Unlike other languages, Python does **not use braces `{}`**.

* Indentation tells Python which statements belong to the same block.
* The standard practice is **4 spaces per indentation level**.
* Mixing indentation incorrectly causes errors.

### Incorrect Example

```python
print("I have no indentation")
    print("I have indentation")
```

**Output:**

```text
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

### Explanation

* The first `print()` statement starts at the beginning of the line.
* The second `print()` statement is indented without belonging to any block.
* Python expects consistent indentation, so it raises an error.

## How Python Programs Are Executed

1. Python reads the code line by line.
2. It checks for syntax errors.
3. Each line is executed sequentially.
4. Errors stop execution immediately.

This makes debugging easier and faster.

---

## Python Programming Terminology (Basic)

* **Variable** – stores data values
* **Function** – reusable block of code
* **Module** – file containing Python code
* **Package** – collection of modules
* **Interpreter** – runs Python code

---

## Why Python for Web Scraping?

Python is especially popular for scraping because:

* Simple syntax
* Powerful libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`)
* Fast development
* Strong community support

This repository uses Python to demonstrate **real-world scraping techniques** step by step.

* Control Flow (if, loops)
* Functions and Modules
* Python for Web Scraping
