# Python Introduction

- 
- 
- 

Python was created in 1991 with a focus on code readability and its ability to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

- Variable types are determined automatically at runtime, simplifying code writing.
- Supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional and procedural programming.

## Understanding Hello World Program in Python

The following is a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.

``` 
# This is a comment. It will not be executed.
print("Hello, World!") 

```

``` 
Hello, World!

```

How does this work:

- print() is a built-in Python function that instructs the computer to display text on the screen.
- "Hello, World!" is a string, which is a sequence of text. In Python, strings are enclosed in quotes (either single ' or double ").
- Anything after a # symbol is acomment. Python ignores comments, but they are useful for explaining code to human readers.

We can also write multi-line comments using triple quotes:

``` 
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can be used to describe larger sections of code.
"""

```

## Indentation in Python

In Python,Indentationis used to define blocks of code. It tells the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block. Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line. The most common convention is to use 4 spaces or a tab, per level of indentation.

``` 
print("I have no Indentation ")
    print("I have tab Indentation ")

```

Output:

ERROR!Traceback (most recent call last):File "<main.py>", line 2print("I have tab Indentation ")IndentationError: unexpected indent

Explanation:

- firstprintstatement has no indentation, so it is correctly executed.
- secondprintstatement hastab indentation, but it doesn't belong to a new block of code. Python expects the indentation level to be consistent within the same block. This inconsistency causes anIndentationError.
